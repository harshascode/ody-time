If you want people to find your website through Google, you need to know the basics of SEO. These are simpler than you might think.

Keep reading to learn what SEO is, how to set things up for success, and how to get indexed.

## SEO fundamentals: 

### What is SEO?

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of growing a website’s organic search traffic. It’s where you do things that help you show up and rank higher in a search engine’s organic results.

### Why is SEO important?
People are likely searching for what you do, and you can attract customers by ranking for those terms. But you’re unlikely to rank without effort, as others are trying to do the same. This is why SEO matters. It helps show Google that you most deserve to rank.

### What are the benefits of SEO?
Most people click one of the first few search results, so higher rankings usually lead to more traffic. Unlike other channels, search traffic tends to be consistent and passive. That’s because the number of searches is usually quite consistent month to month.

Search traffic is also “free.” That’s a big deal because ads can be expensive. 

For example, we get an estimated 1.4M monthly visits from organic search. It would cost us an estimated $1.7M per month to get that same traffic from search ads.

### How do you do SEO?

SEO involves five main steps: 

1.**Keyword research.** Find what people search for.
2.**Content creation.** Craft content for searchers.
3.**On-page SEO.** Make your content as clear as possible.
4.**Link building.** Build trust and authority from other websites.
5.**Technical SEO.** Help search engines find, crawl, and index your content efficiently. 

These steps are the main focus of our beginner’s guide to SEO.

## Setting up for SEO success 

Doing SEO is much easier when your website is properly set up for SEO success. Let’s look at a few ways to do that.

### Get a good domain
Most domains are fine for SEO, so don’t panic if you already have one. But if you’re still shopping around, keep these two elements of a good domain in mind.

#### Domain name
Something short and memorable is best here. Don’t try to shoehorn keywords. Your business name without hyphens or special characters is usually a good bet.

#### Top-level domain (TLD)
This is the part after the name, like .com. Your choice of TLD makes no difference for SEO.[1]  But we think .com is best for most people, as it’s the most recognizable and trusted. For charities, .org or your local equivalent also works. If you only do business in one country outside the U.S., your country code top-level domain (ccTLD), like .co.uk, is fine too. 

It’s best to stay clear of TLDs like .info and .biz that people tend to associate with spam. But it’s not the end of the world if you have one. You can still build a legit website that ranks.

### Use a website platform
Website platforms let you create and manage a website with ease. There are two types:

1. **Hosted platforms.** Everything’s done for you. They host the site, give you ready-made designs, and let you add and edit content without touching code.
2. **Self-hosted platforms.** These also let you add and edit content without code. The difference is that you have to host and install them yourself.

Most SEOs recommend a self-hosted, open-source platform like WordPress because:

+ **It’s customizable.** You can edit the open-source code how you like. There’s also a vast community of developers who know the platform inside out.

+ **It’s extensible.** There are millions of plugins for extending its functionality, including many SEO plugins.

That said, if you value ease of use and support, a hosted solution might be a better fit. All the big ones provide enough SEO capabilities for most people.

### Create a positive user experience
Google wants to rank pages that give visitors a positive experience. Let’s look at a few ways to do this. 

#### Use HTTPS
Nothing is worse for visitors than their personal data being susceptible to hackers. Always encrypt your site with SSL/TLS.

#### Choose an appealing design
Nobody wants to visit a website that looks like it’s from the ’90s. So while there’s no need to redesign your website every few months, it should look good and reflect your brand.

#### Make sure it’s mobile-friendly
More searches are now done on mobile than desktop. So it’s critical that your website is as pleasant to use on mobile as on desktop.

#### Use a readable font size
People browse the web using all kinds of devices. Make sure your content is readable across the board.

#### Avoid intrusive pop-ups and ads
Everyone hates ads, but sometimes you need them. If that’s the case, avoid intrusive interstitials. Pages with these may not rank as highly.

#### Make sure it loads fast
Page speed is a ranking factor on desktop and mobile. But this doesn’t mean your site needs to load lightning fast. It only affects pages that deliver the slowest experience to users.
